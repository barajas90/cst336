            <h2>Spyware</h2>
            <p> Spyware will gather your personal data and send it out to
            advertisers, data firms, or external users. Spyware will normally 
            sell you usage data to advertisers or data firms. They 
            can also steal you information to your usernames and passwords to 
            other accounts or even your identity. This happens to thousands of
            people a year and it isn't an easy thing to come back from.</p><b /.>
                
            <p>What are ways your system might get spyware? The usual methods are 
            Accepting pop-ups without first investigating them, as well as 
            downloading software from a unsecure website, opening emails from 
            spam or unkown senders. As well as from pirating movies, music and games.
            Ways that you may know that you have been infected are recieving pop-ups
            while being offline or online, your system crashing or operating to slow.
